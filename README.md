# MacClassic2FPU
 
This is an expansion card that adds an MC68882 FPU to your Macintosh Classic II.
It's been designed to be as low-cost as possible.

Like [the other FPU card available](https://github.com/dymczykm/classic_ii_fpu) it offers a switchable clock source between the system clock (16 MHz, synchronous operation) and a crystal oscillator on the board - but does not use the *incredibly expensive* TE Connectivity AMP Connector (13€/14$ at Digikey) but uses a **simple 90° Pin-Header connector** (<1€) which can be ordered nearly everywehere.
Still, it fits perfectly:

Also, it gives you the possibility to use **3 types of oscillators** so you can use, whatever is in your drawer:
- SMD solder pads (SM77H)
- DIP 14 and 
- DIP 8 pads
