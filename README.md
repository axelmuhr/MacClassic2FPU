# MacClassic2FPU
 
This is an expansion card that adds an MC68882 FPU to your Macintosh Classic II.
It's been designed to be as low-cost as possible. 

Like [the other FPU card available](https://github.com/dymczykm/classic_ii_fpu) it offers a switchable clock source between the system clock (16 MHz, synchronous operation) and a crystal oscillator on the board - but does not use the *incredibly expensive* TE Connectivity AMP Connector (13€/14$ at Digikey) but uses a simple 90° Pin-Header connector (<1€).
Also, it gives you the possibility to use 3 types of oscillators so you can use, whatever is in your drawer:
- SMD solder pads (SM77H)
- DIP 14 and DIP 8 pads
